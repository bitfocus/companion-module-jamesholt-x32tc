## X32 Theatre Control

X32 Theatre Control helps you mix sound for theatre shows on a Behringer X32 or Midas M32 digital mixing console using control groups (DCAs).

It's an application to create and run control group cues for a show: automating tedious snapshot programming so you can focus on the mix. Additionally, it provides automatic channel level monitoring, seamless backup microphone switching, and QLab remote control from the console.
